## 0x09. Python - Everything is object


# Background context
Everything is an object. Python works differently with different types of objects. Example: Modifying a variable: 

>>> a = 1
>>> b = a
>>> a = 2
>>> b
1
>>>

Here b remains as the initial value of a , even thought a has changed.

>>> l = [1, 2, 3]
>>> m = l
>>> l[0] = 'x'
>>> m
['x', 2, 3]
>>>

l is a list, it is assigned to m (making it a list). A change in either, is reflected on both. This concept is known as aliasing, l and m refer to the same object (the list).

This projects shows different ways python deals with objects.
